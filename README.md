- **data-prep-training.fsx** - F# Interactive script to train a machine learning model (same mdel training code as *dib* notebook without interactive displays).
- **spark-debug.cmd** - Console script to start .NET for Apache Spark in Debug mode.

## About the data

The dataset represents the NYC restaurant inspection results. For more information, see [DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j).

### Get the data

1. Navigate to the [DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) page.
1. Select **Export > CSV**.

1. A csv file is downloaded to your PC.
1. Copy it to the *data* directory and rename it *nyc-restaurant-inspections.csv*.

## Run application

### Cheat sheet

Assuming that you've "installed"

- Maven
- Apache Spark
- Microsoft Spark Worker

in `~/bin`

then here are some commands which can be helpful assuming that you've placed *Maven, Spark and Microsoft.Spark.Worker* in `~/bin`:

```shell
export M2_HOME=~/bin/maven/current
export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
export SPARK_HOME=~/bin/spark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7 # USE THE CORRECT PATH WHERE YOU HAVE SPARK
export PATH="$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export DOTNET_WORKER_DIR=~/bin/Microsoft.Spark.Worker-2.0.0
```

Then, depending upon the shell that you have, run:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc

# OR

source ~/.bashrc
```

### Prepare data

.NET for Apache Spark is used to prepare the raw data for training. To prep data, start Apache Spark.

1. Start Apache Spark in debug mode. **This sample uses Apache Spark 2.4. Depending on your Spark version you might have to reference a different jar from the *jars* directory in your *spark-debug* script.**

    1. Windows CMD Prompt

        ```console
        spark-debug.cmd
        ```

    1. Unix (Linux/Mac)

        ```bash
        ./spark-debug.sh
        ```

**Make sure to keep the window you ran this script on open until *data-prep-modeling.fsx* is done running done preprocessing your data**.

2. Use .NET CLI and F# Interactive to run *data-prep-modeling.fsx*.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet fsi data-prep-modeling.fsx
    ```

This will prepare the data, create an output directory *processed-data* for the results, and save the results to *.csv* files.

3.  **Remember to stop Apache Spark once *data-prep-modeling.fsx* is done preparing the data. `Ctrl + C`**

### Train the model

Automated ML (AutoML) in ML.NET is used to train a regression model to predict the inspection score.  This script trains your model and saved the serialized version of it to a file called *InspectionModel.zip*.

1. Run the script `data-prep-training.fsx` which might take a while:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet fsi data-prep-training.fsx
    ```

## Run Web API

Saturn is used to create an HTTP endpoint to make predictions with the *InspectionModel.zip* model. Use the .NET CLI to start the Web API

Navigate to the *webapi* directory and start your application

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

### Make predictions

Once the Web API starts, send an HTTP **POST** request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "Camis":"41720083",
    "Boro":"Manhattan",
    "InspectionType":"Cycle Inspection / Re-inspection",
    "InspectionScore": 11.0,
    "Violations":"04H,09C,10F",
    "CriticalViolations":1.0,
    "TotalViolations":3.0
}
```

If the request is handled successfully, you should get a response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "InspectionScore": 11,
  "Score": 11.56095
}
```

## Optional (Deploy)

The following commands assume you have the Azure CLI installed & are logged in to your account.

1. Navigate to the *webapi* directory.
1. Get your application ready for deployment

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet publish -c Release -o deploy
    ```

    This command creates a directory called *deploy* containing all the files you'll need to deploy your application.

1. Update the name of your application and resource group in *Deploy.fsx*.
1. Run *Deploy.fsx* to deploy your application.

```dotnetcli
dotnet fsi Deploy.fsx
```

If your deployment is successful, you should see your application in the Azure Portal.
